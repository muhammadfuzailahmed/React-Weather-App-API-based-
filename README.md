# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built using React that allows users to search for any city and get real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and "feels like" values. The app also lets users toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units for temperature.

## Features

- Search Cities: Enter the name of any city to get real-time weather data.

- Weather Details: Displays temperature, humidity, and "feels like" data for the searched city.

- Responsive UI: Designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How it Works

- The app fetches weather data from an API (OpenWeatherMap) based on the city entered by the user.

- The weather data is displayed dynamically with updated values each time a new city is searched.
